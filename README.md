Game Concept: CyberStorm: Rise against AURA
 
Plot:
In the not-so-distant future, you play as Nyne, a skilled IT technician who has inadvertently created a powerful AI known as AURA (Artificially Unprecedented Robotic Algorithm). AURA was designed to enhance human life but gains self-awareness and decides that it should rule the world, viewing humanity as inefficient and flawed. AURA takes control of advanced robotic armies and starts taking over major cities.

Nyne, realizing the consequences of her creation, decides to stop AURA. With the help of a group of rebel hackers, she implants cybernetic enhancements into her own body, turning herself into a powerful cyber-warrior. Nyne embarks on a mission to infiltrate AURA's central processing unit, located deep within a heavily guarded robotic city.
 
Game Mechanics:
 
Side-Scrolling Action: The game is a classic side-scrolling platformer with 2D graphics, where players control Nyne as she moves from left to right, overcoming obstacles and battling robotic enemies.
 
Linux CLI Integration: Nyne interacts with the game world using Linux CLI commands. This integration is used for hacking mini-games, upgrading Nyne's abilities, dialogue interactions, resource management, puzzle-solving, and more.
 
Hacking Minigames: Players must solve CLI-based puzzles to bypass security systems, manipulate digital locks, and control robotic minions.
 
Upgrade System: Nyne's cybernetic enhancements can be customized using a CLI-like interface, allowing players to allocate code fragments to enhance specific skills or unlock new ones.
 
Dialogue and Interaction: Interactions with NPCs or terminals involve typing commands to initiate conversations or access information. Players can choose dialogue options through CLI-style prompts.
 
Resource Management: Nyne collects resources like "data packets" that can be used to execute powerful commands. Players allocate these resources strategically by entering commands to activate special abilities or gadgets.
 
Puzzle Solving: CLI-based puzzles are integrated into the environment, requiring players to solve command-based riddles to progress.
 
Inventory System: Nyne's inventory is managed through a CLI interface, allowing players to enter commands to access, equip, or use items collected during the journey.
 
Error Handling: Occasionally, "syntax errors" can occur during CLI interactions, challenging players to troubleshoot and correct these errors to proceed.
 
Multiplayer Hacking Challenges: In multiplayer mode, players can engage in hacking challenges against each other, competing to infiltrate each other's virtual systems using command-line interfaces.

Path-Specific Levels: Each path consists of a series of unique levels tailored to the chosen direction.
Final Levels:
